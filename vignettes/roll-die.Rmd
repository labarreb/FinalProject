## Roll A Die


![Katamari ROLL!](C:\Users\Brian\Desktop\Program\FinalProject\picdie.png)


This is a simple function designed to simulate rolling a single 6-sided die.  It takes a random sample from a vector of 1:6.


## Examples

When you enter `rdie()` into the terminal, it returns one of the possible numbers:

```{r}
set.seed(777)
rdie()
rdie()
rdie()
rdie()
rdie()
rdie()
```

If you really want to have fun with it, try making a game with it:

```{r}
DiceGame <- function(){
enemy <- c("Evil Man","The Dice Queen","Senor Dicey","Madam Slice","Curious Toddler","Snake Eye","Natasha the Dicer")
you <- rdie()
opp <- rdie()
Your_Turn <- paste("You rolled a ",you,sep="")
Opponent_Turn <- paste(sample(enemy,1)," rolled a ",opp,sep="")
if(you>opp){
  Outcome <- c("YOU WIN! You are a dice master!")
} else if(you<opp){
  Outcome <- c("YOU LOSE! You need to practice rolling dice")
} else{
  Outcome <- c("Draw! You are not a winner... or a loser")
}
return(list(Your_Turn,Opponent_Turn,Outcome))
}
set.seed(115)
DiceGame()
DiceGame()
DiceGame()
```
It would appear you are having a lot of trouble defeating Madam Slice!
