# smod() Function

## Survival Modeling

This function is intended to be used with the `finalproj()` function that offers the you a choice of what kind of program 
you want to initiate.  It can, though, be used on its own to aid in survival modeling and analysis.

### Initialize the Function

The prompt/menu is initialized by typing `smod()` in the console (or through the use of `finalproj()`).  From there, you are asked for input of a dataset.  If you are unsure of the datasets available, try typing `data()` into the console, and it will provide a list of all currently available datasets in the environment.  Once your dataset is selected, you will be asked to begin building your model.

```{r}
# smod()
# Name of your dataset:
```

### Set-Up Your Model

In this part of the function, you are asked for inputs of time variable (the measurement for which survival is being measured over), the event indicator variable (usually "delta","status", or "event"), number of predictor variables, the predictor variable(s) (if any), and inclusion of an interaction term (if applicable).  You can only have one response variable and one interaction term, but you can have as many predictor variables as are in the dataset (including zero).

The benefit of this selection system is that you don't have to remember nor type in the variable names for the model.  The function is designed to bring up all the available selections, which are then chosen by the number preceeding the variable.

```{r}
### Input lines are Indented

##### Time Variable:  
# 
# 1: litter
# 2: rx
# 3: time
# 4: status
# 5: sex
# 
# Selection: 3
##### Event Indicator Variable:  
# 
# 1: litter
# 2: rx
# 3: time
# 4: status
# 5: sex
# 
# Selection: 4
##### How many covariates?: 2
##### Which Predictor Variables to Include:  
# 
# 1: litter
# 2: rx
# 3: time
# 4: status
# 5: sex
# 
# Selection: 2
##### Which Predictor Variables to Include:  
# 
# 1: litter
# 2: rx
# 3: time
# 4: status
# 5: sex
# 
# Selection: 5
##### Would you like an interaction term? 
# 
# 1: Y
# 2: N
```
*These variables were produced from the dataset `rats` from the `survival` package

### Choose Your Model (with `survmod()`)

This step is fairly simple - now that your model has been chosen, you can choose which type of model you would like to use in your analysis.  Options 1-3 are parametric, and option 4 is semi-parametric.  You may certainly choose any of these, but be sure you know which model is appropriate for your data. 

```{r}
##### Which Survival Model?:  
# 
# 1: Weibull Model
# 2: Exponential Model
# 3: Log-Logistic Model
# 4: Cox PH Model
```

### Output Options

In the final series of prompts, you are asked what kind of output you desire.  You are asked whether you would like a summary (which contains coefficients and p-values (frequently requested items)), and whether you would like a plot (if you have chosen just one covariate and a parametric distribution).  The point estimate and 95% confidence intervals of the ratios (rate ratios for models 1-3, hazard ratios for model 4) are given, regardless of what options you select.

```{r}
# Would you like a summary? 
# 
# 1: Y
# 2: N
# 
# 
# Selection: 1
# Would you like a plot of the survival curve? 
# 
# 1: Y
# 2: N

```
